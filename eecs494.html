        In my senior year at the University of Michigan, I've been taking a course in game development called EECS 494. 
        Here you will find a couple of projects I have worked on in this course. <br> <br> </p>

            <h3 class="light-font"> Metroid </h3>
          <p class="light-font"> 
        Our first project was to recreate Metroid for the NES using Unity. My partner and I created an accurate version of a portion of the Brinstar level, and also added a custom mechanic -- the 
        warp shot. You can find a <a href='https://montanamott.dev/source/P1Builds.zip'> link to the builds here</a>. 
         

        <br> <br> 
         </p>
          <h3 class="light-font"> Push </h3>
          <p class="light-font"> 
        The second project I completed in the course was a game of my creation, focused on a mechanic where the player can redirect objects in the world around them. You can 
        find a <a href='https://montanamott.dev/source/mjmott_P2_Gold_Builds.zip'>link to the builds here</a>.

          <h3 class="light-font"> Claire and Netty </h3>
          <p class="light-font"> 
        The third and largest project I completed in EECS 494 was a game called Claire and Netty, which I created with three other teammates. 
            Claire and Netty is a wacky, cartoony 3D-platformer where you must help our feathered friends escape from the RoboCorp zoo. You can find 
            <a href='https://woodwindstudios.itch.io/claire-and-netty'>builds of the game 
                    along with more information here </a>
