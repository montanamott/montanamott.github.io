        Hi there, in my senior year at the University of Michigan, I've been taking a course in game development, EECS 494. 
        Here you will find a couple of projects I have worked on in this course. <br> <br>

        Our first project was to recreate Metroid for the NES using Unity. My partner and I created an accurate version of a portion of the Brinstar level, and also added a custom mechanic -- the 
        warp shot. You can find a <a href='https://montanamott.dev/source/P1Builds.zip'> link to the builds here</a>. 

        <br> <br> 
        The second project I completed in the course was a game of my creation, focused on a mechanic where the player can redirect objects in the world around them. You can 
        find a <a href='https://montanamott.dev/source/mjmott_P2_Gold_Builds.zip'>link to the builds here</a>.
