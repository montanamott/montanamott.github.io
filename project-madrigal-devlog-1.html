      Week 1: Background Research
    </h1>
    <p class="small-size light-font padded"> 
      The main thing I accomplished this week was reading through and compiling research regarding the potential for Project Madrigal.
      This included reading through several technical papers on computer graphics, as well as finding data on relevant industries for Project Madrigal. 
      <br> <br> 
      Here are three technical resources that are especially relevant to Project Madrigal. There are more resources that were considered, which are listed at the very bottom of this blog post. 
    </p>
    <a href='http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.87.339&rep=rep1&type=pdf' class="padded big-link">
      1. Sphere Tracing: A Geometric Method for the Antialiased Ray Tracing of Implicit Surfaces</a>
      <p class="small-size light-font padded"> 
        This paper by John C. Hart introduces the now classic technique of sphere-tracing. Although the paper contains "ray tracing"
        in the title, this technique is often used today for raymarching implicit surfaces with signed distance functions. It involves casting rays 
        into a scene and stepping forward along the ray at varying spherical distances to check if geometry is intersected.

        2. Rendering a Sphere on a Quad</a>

        <p class="small-size light-font padded"> 
          This article by Ben Golus takes a deep dive into generating raytraced imposter objects that can blend into a scene next to 
          rasterized objects. Golus uses Unity and documents the process and theory of getting a raytraced sphere (not a typical sphere mesh), 
          to work seamlessly with Unity's shadowing and lighting systems.

          3. My Journey Into Fractals</a>
          <p class="small-size light-font padded"> 
          This is an article by Gregory Ivanov about the technical details and development of the game "Yedoma Globula." (YG). YG is 
          unique because it features a fractal world (rendered through raymarching), that the player can explore. The thing that 
          really makes YG stand out is the immense, beautiful detail of the fractals, and the fact that there are physics collisions that take 
          place between the first person player and the raymarched fractals.

          Market Research
        </h1>

        <p class="small-size light-font padded"> 
          The main notable market for Project Madrigral is that of the video game industry. Project Madrigal would be relevant 
          for studios that develop video games, as well as technology companies that create software to aid video game developers. <br/><br/>
          The overall value of the video game market in the U.S. as of 2020 <a href='https://www.statista.com/topics/868/video-games/'>
            was 60.4 billion USD</a>
          <br> <br/>
          There are several large companies within the video game industry. Companies that develop game engines are of particularly relevance 
          to Project Madrigal, but game studios are relevant as well since the goal of Project Madrigal is to highlight and create reproduceable techniques for 
          solid raymarched geometry integration into games. Here are five such companies:
        </p>

        <a href='https://unity.com/our-company' class="padded big-link">

              Relevant Products
            </h1>
            <p class="small-size light-font padded"> 
              
              The companies above give a good idea of who some of the heavy hitters are in the gaming industry, and some of them even 
              develop technologies that could utilize the work done in Project Madrigal or compete with it. I will now go over five such products that 
              either address similar problems to Project Madrigal or could benefit from it.
            
          </p>

        <a href='https://codeparade.itch.io/marblemarcher' class="padded big-link">
          1. Marble Marcher</a>

          <p class="small-size light-font padded"> 
            Marble Marcher is a game developed by a developer who goes by CodeParade. Marble Marcher is interesting in that it solves some of the problems 
            Project Madrigal aims to solve. Specifically, it is comprised of fractal levels that you must roll around in to capture a flag and complete the level. 
            The fractals use raymarching, and there is interactivity in the game due to the physics between the player (a raymarched sphere) and the raymarched fractal solids. You can 
            also play a version of the game in your web browser <a href='https://www.shadertoy.com/view/3lKyDR'>
              on ShaderToy here  </a>(the whole game was ported into a fragment shader!) Marble Marcher could actually benefit from the work done 
              in Project Madrigal, as the aim would be to create ways in which rasterized objects could be added to flesh out the game even further (currently the game only contains raymarched objects). 
          </p>

          <a href='https://bananaft.itch.io/yedomaglobula' class="padded big-link">
            2. Yedoma Globula</a>
  
            <p class="small-size light-font padded"> 
              Yedoma Globula is a game developed by Greg Ivanov. The reason it is relevant to Project Madrigal is similar to why Marble Marcher was -- it features 
              a raymarched, fractal world that the player can explore. However, the lighting and visuals of Yedoma are of extremely high quality and look even close 
              to AAA standards. Interestingly, there looks to be some rasterized geometry in the game that sits on the raymarched fractals -- the interactions between them 
              with respect to shadowing seem to be fleshed out but faked slightly. There also does not appear to be any sort of physics between the rasterized 
              and raymarched objects. This, specifically, is where the work in Project Madrigal could be useful to this wonderful project. 
            </p>

          <a href='https://kev.town/raymarching-toolkit/' class="padded big-link">
            3. Raymarching Toolkit for Unity</a>
  
            <p class="small-size light-font padded"> 
              The Raymarching Toolkit for Unity is a plugin for Unity that allows users to add raymarched objects to their scene (a scene that can also contain rasterized geometry). 
              However, the toolkit has some limitations, such as that the raymarched objects are not seamlessly integrated into Unity's lighting and shadowing, and they are not 
              accurately collideable. As a result, the work in the toolkit currently seems to be best for background objects or imposters (the graphics kind, not the Among Us kind!). 
              I think work done in Project Madrigal would even be relevant to this project, as seamlessly integrating raymarching into Unity is on the  
                <a href='https://kev.town/raymarching-toolkit/roadmap/'> roadmap for the raymarching toolkit.  </a>
            </p>

          <a href='https://unity.com/our-company' class="padded big-link">
            4. Unity (Game Engine)</a>
  
            <p class="small-size light-font padded"> 
              This product is more broad than the others, but I believe the work in Project Madrigal could be useful to Unity as a whole, with potential to work 
              as a plugin. Being able to have interactive raymarched geometry in scenes would allow gamemakers to develop more kinds of games with art styles 
              that don't work as well in rasterized geometry. Having seamless integration of raymarched geometry in the engine would also be a nice way to help 
              gamedevs create interesting and stylistic environments with potentially less work. 
            </p>

            <a href='https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/' class="padded big-link">
              5. Unreal Engine</a>
    
              <p class="small-size light-font padded"> 
                Unreal has actually taken some rendering steps in the past few years that would provide interesting ways the kind of work in Project Madrigal 
                could be useful. Namely, Unreal accomplishes a lot of their <a href='http://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2015/DynamicOcclusionWithSignedDistanceFields.pdf'> shadowing and occlusion by using Signed Distance Field techniques</a>, where these fields 
                and functions are generated for rasterized scene geometry offline. A lot of this is similar to how shadowing would be accomplished in raymarching, which 
                would make high quality raymarched solids integrate well with Unreal's existing technology. 
              </p>

                Audience Information
              </h1>

              <p class="small-size light-font padded"> 
                One of the main audiences I see for the work done in Project Madrigal are Indie Game developers, specifically those who 
                are graphics or rendering inclined or aim to create a stylized game that benefits from raymarching. The reason I specifically suggest Indie Game Developers, is that Project Madrigal is intended to present 
                some nice new avenues for environment creation in games, which could save time doing typical environment modeling work. It also has the potential 
                to provide exploration of more novel game ideas, such as games featuring fractals or higher dimensional spaces in more interactive ways than are possible now, 
                which are typically pursued by indie developers as seen in some of my product examples above. 
                <br/> <br/>
                Indie developers are a quite varied group, so making generalizations is tough, but they tend to work in smaller groups (order of magnitude 10 or fewer) on games usually using 
                a third party engine such as Unity. They are usually more limited with resources as they are smaller. Stability of tooling and ease of use is important is important to 
                Indie Game Developers, so the work in Project Madrigal needs to be presented in a user friendly way or manner that would be easy to adapt for their own games.

                my research for Project Madrigal. Many of these are techniques in raymarched graphics, rasterized graphics, or hybrids of both.
