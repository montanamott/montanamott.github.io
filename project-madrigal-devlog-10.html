    This week in Project Madrigal I worked on touching up my gameplay features to get them ready for the final demo. 

    <br/> <br/> 

    First, I added more UI to make them game more readable. I added hearts representing the player's health, and I added star shapes representing the collectables. These can be seen here:

   Next, I worked to make the combat feel a lot better than before. Now, clicking causes the player to go into aim mode which shows an indicator of where the player will launch the fractal bullet. Then, another left click launches the fractal towards the enemies.

 I also made the fractal bullet orbit the player (when not being launched at enemies), and it actually indicates to the player which direction the next star collectable is. This makes the hunt for collectables more approachable. 
Then, I worked on a final "cut-scene" for the game, in which the main character uses the collected star energy to generate a large blast of fractal magic that reforms the planet back to its spherical shape.

  If you would like to play the current development build,  <a href='https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z4mJgcRnfsqFIqEeg2221o3_0NreKYg_?usp=sharing'> you can find Mac and Windows zips containing the appropriate executables here.</a>
  I was not able to add audio this week, so I hope to get some effects in along with some last minute tweaks before the final demo next week. See you all then!
