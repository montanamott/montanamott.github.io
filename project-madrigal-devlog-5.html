   This week for Project Madrigal I focued mainly on physics. My goal is to make it possible for rasterized geometry to be able to collide and interact with raymarched geometry as seamlessly as possible. <br/> <br/>

   The two main games I've seen with interactive raymarched geometry, <a href='https://bananaft.itch.io/yedomaglobula'> Yedoma Globula </a> and <a href='https://codeparade.itch.io/marblemarcher'> Marble Marcher </a>
   (please go check both of them out, they are wonderful), both use spherical colliders on their player to make their solids interactable. This is because in a classical collision system, you would need a primitive or mesh collider 
   on the raymarched geometry in order to have a primitive or mesh collider on a player. However, you can't usually accurately represent the collision of raymarched geometry with a primitive shape, and since the geometry is not stored as 
   a mesh, doing mesh collisions is out of the question if we want to do the raymarching dynamically in realtime (which is my current aim). I specify "dynamically" here, because for certain static raymarched geometry it could theoretically be possible 
   to generate a mesh offline for collision, but that is not the focus of Project Madrigal right now.

   <br/> <br/> 
   As a result of this, for now I am pursuing spherical colliders for dynamic objects that need to collide with raymarched geometry -- however, my aim is to support objects with multiple composited spherical colliders to get results as close as possible to a typical collision system. 
   Do note, that with this approach I would likely still have a regular mesh collider on geometry to handle collisions with rasterized objects. 
   <br/> <br/>
  The reason spherical colliders work is because raymarched geometry is specified using signed distance functions; recall that with signed distance functions, we can tell how far an arbitrary point is from our raymarched geometry's surface, but we cannot 
  tell exactly where that closest point is on our surface. Therefore, we can detect if a spherical collider is colliding with a raymarched surface simply be checking if the SDF function evaluated from the sphere collider's origin 
  returns a number less than our radius. Then, we can use a normal vector from the surface to determine how to resolve our collision. I've drawn a diagram here of what it might look like for a sphere to collide with a green SDF surface.

      This is the approach I took, although I did something a bit different (I believe) from the two games I mentioned above. I evaluated my normal vector for my raymarched surface not on the surface itself, but at the 
      origin of my spherical collider. This is because the gradient method used to calculate the normal vector for a signed distance function will give a vector that gives the locally optimal direction for maximizing distance from the surface -- which 
      I believe is usually a good estimator of the appropriate escape vector to remove the sphere collider from the SDF surface. This worked out well, and I have a video demo of my progress here:

      In this next week I will aim to iterate on my physics work and flesh out more precise collisions with more complex raymarched and rasterized geometry. I also aim to better integrate my C# code and shader code so that 
      I can do more with dynamically changing fractals to explore more interesting gameplay experiences.
